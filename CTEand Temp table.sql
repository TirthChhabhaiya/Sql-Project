-- Using Common Table Expressions (CTE)
-- A CTE allows you to define a subquery block that can be referenced within the main query. 
-- It is particularly useful for recursive queries or queries that require referencing a higher level
-- this is something we will look at in the next lesson/

-- Let's take a look at the basics of writing a CTE:


-- First, CTEs start using a "With" Keyword. Now we get to name this CTE anything we want
-- Then we say as and within the parenthesis we build our subquery/table we want
WITH CTE_Example AS 
(
SELECT gender, SUM(salary), MIN(salary), MAX(salary), COUNT(salary), AVG(salary)
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
GROUP BY gender
)
-- directly after using it we can query the CTE
SELECT *
FROM CTE_Example;


-- Now if I come down here, it won't work because it's not using the same syntax
SELECT *
FROM CTE_Example;



-- Now we can use the columns within this CTE to do calculations on this data that
-- we couldn't have done without it.

WITH CTE_Example AS 
(
SELECT gender, SUM(salary), MIN(salary), MAX(salary), COUNT(salary)
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
GROUP BY gender
)
-- notice here I have to use back ticks to specify the table names  - without them it doesn't work
SELECT gender, ROUND(AVG(`SUM(salary)`/`COUNT(salary)`),2)
FROM CTE_Example
GROUP BY gender;



-- we also have the ability to create multiple CTEs with just one With Expression

WITH CTE_Example AS 
(
SELECT employee_id, gender, birth_date
FROM employee_demographics dem
WHERE birth_date > '1985-01-01'
), -- just have to separate by using a comma
CTE_Example2 AS 
(
SELECT employee_id, salary
FROM parks_and_recreation.employee_salary
WHERE salary >= 50000
)
-- Now if we change this a bit, we can join these two CTEs together
SELECT *
FROM CTE_Example cte1
LEFT JOIN CTE_Example2 cte2
	ON cte1. employee_id = cte2. employee_id;


-- the last thing I wanted to show you is that we can actually make our life easier by renaming the columns in the CTE
-- let's take our very first CTE we made. We had to use tick marks because of the column names

-- we can rename them like this
WITH CTE_Example (gender, sum_salary, min_salary, max_salary, count_salary) AS 
(
SELECT gender, SUM(salary), MIN(salary), MAX(salary), COUNT(salary)
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
GROUP BY gender
)
-- notice here I have to use back ticks to specify the table names  - without them it doesn't work
SELECT gender, ROUND(AVG(sum_salary/count_salary),2)
FROM CTE_Example
GROUP BY gender;


-- Using Temporary Tables
-- Temporary tables are tables that are only visible to the session that created them. 
-- They can be used to store intermediate results for complex queries or to manipulate data before inserting it into a permanent table.

-- There's 2 ways to create temp tables:
-- 1. This is the less commonly used way - which is to build it exactly like a real table and insert data into it

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table
(first_name varchar(50),
last_name varchar(50),
favorite_movie varchar(100)
);

-- if we execute this it gets created and we can actualyl query it.

SELECT *
FROM temp_table;
-- notice that if we refresh out tables it isn't there. It isn't an actual table. It's just a table in memory.

-- now obviously it's balnk so we would need to insert data into it like this:

INSERT INTO temp_table
VALUES ('Alex','Freberg','Lord of the Rings: The Twin Towers');

-- now when we run it and execute it again we have our data
SELECT *
FROM temp_table;

-- the second way is much faster and my preferred method
-- 2. Build it by inserting data into it - easier and faster

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE salary_over_50k
SELECT *
FROM employee_salary
WHERE salary > 50000;

-- if we run this query we get our output
SELECT *
FROM temp_table_2;

-- this is the primary way I've used temp tables especially if I'm just querying data and have some complex data I want to put into boxes or these temp tables to use later
-- it helps me kind of categorize and separate it out

-- In the next lesson we will look at the Temp Tables vs CTEs
